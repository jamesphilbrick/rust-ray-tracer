# rust-ray-tracer
A ray tracer implemented in Rust ðŸ¦€

This is my Rust implimentation of the wonderful [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.
While I'm very much interested in learning how the meths and algorithms behind rendering software works its magic, this is ultimately an excuse to dive into learning
rust by diving into a likely overly-complicated project (given that I am merely a humble beginner and have mostly played around with Python in the past).
