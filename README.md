This is my Rust implimentation of the wonderful [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.
While I'm very much interested in learning how the mathematical methods and algorithms behind rendering software work their magic, this is ultimately an excuse to 
dive into learningrust by diving into a likely overly-complicated project (given that I am merely a humble beginner and have mostly played around with Python in the past). Not only is this a driver to learn Rust with a good introduction to what the language has to offer, but it'll also force me to embrace OOP to some extent; 
ashamedly, this is a topic I've been avoiding up until this point and I think it's high time I just embrace it and see what I can learn from it. 

I consider this project as a personal learning tool and nothing else. I should therefore state that others have followed along with *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* and have created better Rust implementations which in some cases even add features on top of the origional material. See [@dps](https://github.com/dps/rust-raytracer) and [@cbiffle](https://github.com/cbiffle/rtiow-rust) for functional implimentations. 

If upon finishing this project I find myself hungry to learn more about ray tracing and rendering techniques, I may create a new project to compliment [Physically Based Rendering](https://pbrt.org/) (I've heard many good things about this book). [@Twinklebear](https://github.com/Twinklebear/tray_rust) has done just this and you can colour me inspired.
